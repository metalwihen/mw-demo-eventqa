During an Event, users can ask questions via this app, and the speaker can answer the questions all at once by the end of the event.

2. Click on a question item to upvote or downvote it.

3. Long press a question to delete it.

###IBM Bluemix Services Used:

1. **Mobile Data** – A NOSQL database with file storage capabilities with management and analytics features.

2. **Push** – Push data on either Apple APNS or Google GCM platforms – all with a single API. 

3. **Mobile Application Security** – Security service enables you to block any devices and/or users using your application, provides user authentication, and provides analytics for app/device usage, OS distribution, and time/activity.

4. **Mobile Quality Assurance** - Capture tester feedback and live user experience to continuously build and deliver high quality mobile apps.
